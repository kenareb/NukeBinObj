## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- PowerShell (for build scripts)

### Build Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NukeBin.git
   cd NukeBin
   ```

2. **Build the project**

   ```bash
   .\build.ps1
   ```

3. **Install locally**

   ```bash
   .\install.ps1 -AddToPath
   ```

### Manual Build

```bash
# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Build
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Publish self-contained executable
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained true --output ./publish
```

## Distribution Methods

### 1. Self-Contained Executable

- Single `.exe` file with no dependencies
- Works on any Windows machine
- Larger file size (~50MB)

### 2. Framework-Dependent

- Requires .NET 8.0 Runtime
- Smaller file size (~150KB)
- Better for development environments

### 3. GitHub Releases

- Automated builds via GitHub Actions
- Multiple platform support
- Versioned releases

## Team Distribution

### Method 1: Shared Network Drive

1. Build the executable: `.\build.ps1`
2. Copy `NukeBin.exe` to shared network location
3. Team members can run directly or copy to local machine

### Method 2: Internal Package Manager

- Use Chocolatey, NuGet, or similar package manager
- Create internal package repository
- Team members install via package manager

### Method 3: GitHub Releases (After First Release)

1. Tag a release: `git tag v1.0.0`
2. Push tags: `git push --tags`
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and create release
4. Team members download from [releases page](https://github.com/kenareb/NukeBinObj/releases)

## Safety Features

- ‚úÖ Only deletes folders named exactly `bin` or `obj`
- ‚úÖ Case-insensitive matching
- ‚úÖ Recursive directory traversal
- ‚úÖ Error handling for permission issues
- ‚úÖ Progress feedback during operation
- ‚úÖ Confirmation of deleted folders

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denie

- Run as Administrator if accessing system directories
- Check folder permissions
- Ensure folders are not in use by other applications

### Path Not Found

- Verify the path exists
- Use absolute paths if relative paths fail
- Check for typos in the path

### PowerShell Execution Policy

If you get execution policy errors:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
